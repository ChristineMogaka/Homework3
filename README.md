# Homework3
This assignment is a follow-on to Homework 2. We will use the design in Homework 2 as the starting point to implement the GreenBox Entertainment Media System using classes. Use of STL collections is allowed.  You will have a .cpp and a .h file for each of the 6 classes, plus a .cpp file for main. This is a minimum. If you choose to modularize more that is ok. At a minimum this will create 13 files  Then you will have a makefile to build your program so that is now a total of 14 files  Then you need a word/pdf file as the report. you can read the expectations for the report in the rubric. That brings the total to 15 files. these should all be zipped into a single file for submission. You will also turn in a modified version of your design from hw 2 reflecting any significant changes from your original design. This makes the total 16 files  Be sure your code has a header comment block with your name, course and assignment number. you should use your pseudocode from the design document as comments to guide your coding in each of the member functions.  for your zip file use your 3 (or 2) initials plus hw3.zip (ex dmkhw3.zip)
